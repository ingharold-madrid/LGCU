Package: LGCU
Title: Implementation of Learning Gamma CUSUM
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Harold Manuel Madrid-Alvarez", email = "harold.madrid@unisimon.edu.co", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Provides functions for process monitoring and control using 
 CUSUM control charts tailored for Gamma distributions. It includes methods 
 for estimating distribution parameters, simulating control limits, and 
 implementing cautious learning schemes to enhance detection performance. 
 The package supports both upward and downward CUSUM monitoring with 
 guaranteed performance, leveraging Monte Carlo simulations and adaptive 
 thresholding. It is useful for quality control applications in industries 
 where data follows a Gamma distribution.
