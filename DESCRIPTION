Title: Implementation of Learning Gamma CUSUM (Cumulative Sum) Control Charts
Version: 0.1.2
Authors@R: person("Harold Manuel Madrid-Alvarez", email = "harold.madrid@unisimon.edu.co", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Description: Implements Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) control charts specifically
 designed for monitoring processes following a Gamma distribution. Provides
 functions to estimate distribution parameters, simulate control limits, and
 apply cautious learning schemes for adaptive thresholding. It supports
 upward and downward monitoring with guaranteed performance evaluated via
 Monte Carlo simulations. It is useful for quality control applications in
 industries where data follows a Gamma distribution. Methods are based on
 Madrid-Alvarez et al. (2024) <doi:10.1002/qre.3464> and Madrid-Alvarez et
 al. (2024) <doi:10.1080/08982112.2024.2440368>.
